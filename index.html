      Hello, my name is Roger! As of right now I am a Software Engineering Major
      in my second year. I was somewhat undecisive about my career path but I've
      made my decision as to what I want to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are lots of things that I like to do. I bought a piano keyboard
      recently so I've been learning to play some songs and that has been really
      fun. I am trying to learn Fur Elise and it has been tricky but rewarding!
      I like playing video games, and spending time with family and friends.
